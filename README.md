### How to Install and Run the Project:

To successfully run this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "NLPe" Jupyter Notebook file here online or on your local PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all required libraries and data frames from the Section "Importing modules and libraries".

	Step 3. Import the dataset for each of subprojects. Run the cell of the "Load and inspect the data" Section for the corresponding part of a project to get the previously mentioned project goals due to the corresponding NLP technique.

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
